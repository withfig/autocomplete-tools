The list of suggestions is the same as before, but the filtered suggestions are now `commit`, `clean`, `clone`, and `checkout`.\n\n**Why don't we recalculate suggestions on each keystroke?**\n1. It's expensive\n2. We don't need to. The caching works nicely\n\n**So what does the trigger do?**\nThe trigger function is run on every keystroke and tells us whether or not we should invalidate the cache and regenerate a list of suggestions.\nThe trigger function is almost always used with a `custom` generator and the `getQueryTerm` function to make the autocomplete experience really good (it's how suggestions for `cd` work)\nIt is especially beneficial when you want to generate suggestions for an argument contained inside a single string that is not separated by a space.\n\n**What is important to remember?**\nThis function looks at the CHANGE in a token, not the current state of the token. If my token goes from `desktop` to `desktop/`, should I regenerate suggestions? Remember, users can paste text so theoretically any change is possible.
